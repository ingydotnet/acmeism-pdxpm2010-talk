                         TestML Design Goals
     
     * TestML use portable coding
     * reParse to parse the language
     
     * TestML works with multiple test *frameworks*
     * Python == unittest, py.test, nose
     * Runner class for each framework
     
     * Language specific code goes in a Bridge class
     * Bridge classes may one day be C'Dent!
