                    C'Dent is Statically Typed!!
     
     * OSDC Langs are dynamically, and often weakly, typed
     * AST needs exact types to generate code
     * Simple example:
     
        if str == 'foo' or num == 42:
        if ($str eq 'foo' or $num == 42) {
     
     * C'Dent scans the AST and assigns a type to every object
     * If it can't find the type or finds a mismatch...
       ... it's a *compile-time* error.
     
     * At runtime there is no extra type checking
